### Hi there 👋 I'm Ilona

What I really love?
- Travels, ocean, animals and of course programming :)

I'm working as backend developer more than 6 years. Especially in development banking system.
A year ago, I realized that I wanted to change the direction of my work and I started learning web technologies.
Finished Yandex Prakticum cources and continue to search and study new information 🤓

At this moment, I started searching for a web development job. The repository contains educational projects.
